	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See zram.txt for more information.

	depends on ZRAM
	select CRYPTO_LZ4
	default n
	help
	  This option enables LZ4 compression algorithm support. Compression
	  algorithm can be changed using `comp_algorithm' device attribute.
